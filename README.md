IDS Showcase. Improving manufacturing processes by data sharing

Most manufacturing plans incorporate two types of machines in the production chain:

+ Milling machines, producing objects by means of using rotary cutters to remove material from a workpiece of raw material
+ Coordinate-Measuring Machines (CMM), for measuring the physical geometrical characteristics of manufactured objects in order to detect defects, etc.

Each machine could improve its configuration and maintenance by means of using data produced by the other machines, bringing overall a better service to its customer (the Factory)
