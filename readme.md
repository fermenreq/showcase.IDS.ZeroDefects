# FIWARE Milling Machine adaptor

This script will translate data output from a Milling Machine (sensors, status...) to NGSIv2. These data is generated by a Milling Machine in a CSV format a a set of time stamps, and each time stamp providing information of the different sensors from the machine:

Each CSV file provided by the MM represents the building of an specific piece/part. The script will take this input using a configuration file. The configuration file marks which columns will be translated, the data type and the attribute name that will be used in NGSI.


```
{
  "config": [{
     "colunm_name": "spindle_brg_temp",
      "type": "Float",
      "attribute_name" : "spindle_brg_temp"
    },
    {
     "colunm_name": "module_8_state",
      "type": "Integer",
      "attribute_name": "module_8_state"
    },
    {
     "colunm_name": "tool",
      "type": "Integer",
      "attribute_name": "tool_to"
    }
  ]
}

```

You can send any column just configuring this file with the name of the column, the data type, and the name you want to use for the NGSI representation:
 * "column_name" is a name of a column in the output file from the MM
 * "type" is the type, it will be used for NGSI type
 * "attribute_name" is the name to be used for NGSI. Usually, this name could be the same as column_name, but you could use a different one for having any kind of representation about your NGSI data model. 

According to this configuration: 

 * A device will be created with tree attributes.
 * A CSV file will be parsed to extract columns spindle_brg_temp, module_8_state and tool
 * Each row, representing a time stamp, will be send to Orion about these columns. Translated into a JSON NGSIv2


## Generated data models

### JSON example about entity creation

This script will create an entity representing a Milling Machine with different sensors, according to previous configuration.

Creating de entity Milling Machine

{
    "spindle_brg_temp": {
        "type": "Float", 
        "value": 0
    }, 
    "module_8_state": {
        "type": "Integer", 
        "value": 0
    }, 
    "type": "FirstMachineDevice", 
    "id": "MillingMachine", 
    "tool_to": {
        "type": "Integer", 
        "value": 0
    }
}


For each row of the CSV file generate by the Milling Machine, attributes specified in the configuration file will be send as NGSI attributes:

Example of a JSON generated for a meassuremnt (CSV row) and attributes:

```
{
    "spindle_brg_temp": {
        "type": "Float", 
        "value": 34.275
    }, 
    "module_8_state": {
        "type": "Integer", 
        "value": 2
    }, 
    "tool_to": {
        "type": "Integer", 
        "value": 12
    }, 
    "currentPart": "MM_data_output/Transfer_data_MPT_18_Impeller_0002_ref_APS_ok.csv"
}

```

currentPart attribute represents the name of the part/piece that is been generated by the Milling Machine


## How to run it

The script has been developed with Python, so, you need Python installed in your system.

The default ORION broker URL will be http://localhost:1026 you can use the environmental variable ORION_URL to overwrite this value:

```
$> export ORION_URL=http://127.0.0.1:1026

$> ./script.py input_file.csv 
```

Parameters:

 * input_file.csv is a data file generated by a Milling MAchine
